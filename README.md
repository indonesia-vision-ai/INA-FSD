## Description

Most FAS models are evaluated for their generalization capabilities by testing on an excluded set of conditions. However, the most commonly used datasets and protocols cover only 2D printed paper and display attacks and have limited variation of spoof medium and capture sensors. Moreover, only a few datasets have distinct information on image quality and protocol exploring their effect on FAS. 

To explore this area, we present a new dataset, Indonesian Face Spoof Dataset (INA-FSD) that consists of 74 subjects, with 76 smartphone models and 14 webcam models for acquisition devices, totaling 398,844 final images. To explore the effect of image quality on the performance of FAS models, an image-quality-based out-of-distribution protocol is proposed based on the INA-FSD dataset that differentiates multiple camera hardware types and their quality. 

Experiments are conducted on three state-of-the-art methods on the proposed protocols: SSDG-R, SA-FAS, and DiVT. Results indicate that state-of-the-art FAS methods still have much to improve on generalization across image quality domains. Additionally, the combination of quality domains for training dramatically affects performance in a limited domain scenario.
